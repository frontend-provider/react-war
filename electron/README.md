# [ArcoMage HD](https://github.com/arcomage/arcomage-hd) Desktop Version

See [the main README file](../README.md) for information on ArcoMage HD.

**The Desktop Version is merely a Google Chrome browser-like wrapper that visits the URL [https://arcomage.github.io/](https://arcomage.github.io/).**

You can use the Desktop Version if you don't have Google Chrome or Chrome's engine based browsers.

Based on Chrome's engine (Blink or WebKit) and good for ArcoMage HD (as of 2021):

*(\*: I didn't really test these browsers)*

* Google Chromium
* Google Chrome
* Brave
* Edge
* Opera \*
* Maxthon \*
* Vivaldi \*
* QQ \*
* Sogou \*
* Baidu \*
* Yandex Browser \*
* UC Browser \*
* CM Browser \*
* etc.

Not or partially based on Chrome's engine, and may or may not run ArcoMage HD very well, therefore you can use the Desktop Version:

* Internet Explorer: this old browser, of course, does not work
* Firefox & Safari: you can play the game with these browsers, but they do not have as good performance as Chrome's engine based browsers therefore may be a bit slow, it depends on your CPU / GPU
  * Pale Moon \*

The Desktop Version is not expected to be updated. The Desktop Version's version number is different from ArcoMage HD's. Actually the Desktop Version may stays v1.0.0 forever unless there's really something to update.

The first time you run ArcoMage HD Desktop Version, it downloads all the images and sound files silently. You should wait maybe 1 minute (depending on your Internet speed), before you can cut off Internet and play it completely offline.

If you install both Google Chrome and the Desktop Version, the Desktop Version will have independent storage. Clearing your Google Chrome's stored data will not reset the Desktop Version's settings.
